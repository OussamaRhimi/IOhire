# IOhire Sprint Plan (4 Months)

Recommended baseline: **4 sprints** across 16 weeks.

| Sprint | Suggested Duration | Main Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| Sprint 1 | 3-4 weeks | Foundation, authentication, job posting management |
| Sprint 2 | 3-4 weeks | Public application flow and HR candidate management |
| Sprint 3 | 3-4 weeks | AI pipeline (parse, score, standardized CV, templates) |
| Sprint 4 | 2-4 weeks | Analytics, operations cron jobs, deployment hardening |

## If your school asks for only 3 sprints

Merge Sprint 3 and Sprint 4:

- Sprint 1: Foundation + Auth + Jobs
- Sprint 2: Candidate flow + HR management
- Sprint 3: AI + Analytics + Operations/Deployment

You can still keep the same diagrams and state in the report that Sprint 4 scope was integrated into Sprint 3 for planning constraints.
